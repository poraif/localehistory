## Introduction
People's history - i.e. the events and stories of normal people and communities - can be hard to learn about and find without insider or local knowledge. This web app will allow users to add, collate and share points of interest to facilitate sharing and preserving stories both within the local community, and for interested visitors.

## Features
1.	Users can securely sign up and log in to the service.
2.	Collate points of interest by inputting some required and optional details in the app.
3.	Add a street, and upload images for each street. 
4.	Add content with various categories, such as major events, birthplaces, landmarks, statues and more.
5.	Admin dashboard to view and delete user accounts.

## Features for future releases
-	Interactive map API to visualise the locations of the points of interest.
-	Follow other users who post similar content.
-	Rate other posts for utility/interest.
-	Suggest edits to other posts - for example to improve accuracy.
- Upvote or downvote posts for relevancy.
